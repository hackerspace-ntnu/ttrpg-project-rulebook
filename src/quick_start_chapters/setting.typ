<setting>
This game is set after an event called the Collapse, wherein a prosperous, highly advanced global civilization was destroyed by tremendous creatures, called Titans, emerging from Mana Gateways that they were using to power their cities.
The destabilization wrought by the Collapse to the world dried up the seas and turned the land arid.
Now water and vegetation is mostly found clustered around Mana Gates, where the creatures most twisted by the Mana also roam.
Mana is akin to radiation, in that it suffuses an area invisibly and causes mutations, but Mana mutations are quick and dramatic.
Mana also disrupts electric currents, rendering conventional technology inoperable.
Mana density increases in proximity to a Gate or Titan.
Due to the danger inherent in living in these areas of dense Mana, most of civilization is found in the dry lands away from the Gates.
A few years ago, within living memory, a prophesied being called the Titanslayer managed to actually fell one (1) Titan.
Now those who delve into the depths of the Mana-saturated areas dream of accruing enough power (through beneficial mutations, wealth, advanced mana-tech, training and whatever means necessary) to fell a second Titan and claim the title of . . .

Optional lore expansion (can be excised for pagecount/conciseness): \
One of the most ardent sponsors of would-be Titanslayers is the University of Human Understanding and their world-spanning project to catalogue and categorize #emph[everything];, the Understanding. 
In most cities and towns, there will be an agent of the Understanding willing to provide payment for bits of knowledge and physical specimens. \
TODO: Expand lore expansion to add a few more factions (Og, Kaleina, those idiots who claimed the first titanslayer)
