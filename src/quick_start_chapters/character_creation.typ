= Character creation
<character-creation-mutations>
Everyone needs a character in order to play. The stats of the player is
tied to their background and heritage, so the mechanics a player will be
specializing in is based on who they choose to be.

All characters start with some base stats: \
Max #term[Strain]: 8 \
Max #term[Focus]: 8 \
Base #term[Speed]: 4 Spaces

Each character has 4 #term[Attributes]. Each #term("Attribute", key: "Attributes", is_definition: true) is represented by a die of size d4-d12, mapping to a modifier of 0-4.

    term("Insight", is_definition: true), [Ability to discover and reason about information], [\+
    mod to crits, rolls with boon and rolls when flanking],
    term("Presence", is_definition: true), [Inner focus and the power to inspire or command], [\+
    mod to Focus],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

On creation, arrange \[d4, d6, d6, d8\] how you want your character's
attributes to be.

== Titles
At creation and after big moments in the campaign, you earn #term("Titles", is_definition: true).
#term[Titles] are primarily narrative in that they describe your character, and
may be referred to at any time by either the player or GM for roleplay
purposes. Titles provide a static bonus to a roll when invoked, which
can be done for 1 focus in situations where it makes narrative sense.

== Mutations
#show link: underline
Choose any #term("Mutations") you'd like from the mutation table
#link("https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkKA1ifbYqop71Pm5RrK5ofa_Z9V3Yyyje8CdN3MKn4/edit?tab=t.eulwm9krcgii")[#text(fill: purple)[document]];,
or make up your own, then notify the GM of your choices. You have 2 free
mutations, but purely cosmetic costs no slots. For each mutation past
the first 2, one of your Focus is permanently Corrupted.

== Archetypes
If you're not sure where to start in terms of attributes, weapons,
armor, and equipment, here are some options.

If you want to play a character who can move quickly around the
battlefield and attack at range, Agility and Insight are good choices
for your highest Attribute scores. Take 2 Kunai/Daggers (your choice), a
Longbow, a quiver, and either a bandolier with 3 more Kunai/Daggers or
Light Armor.

If you want your character to be able to withstand a lot of attacks, you should focus on Might and Insight. Take a Warhammer, Heavy Shield, Boomerang, and Heavy Armor. You may want an extra Boomerang or two. It's important to have a repair kit since this build is intended to block damage using the durability of your armor and shield.

Alternatively, you can focus on dealing damage in melee, in which case Might and Presence are important Attributes. Choose a Greatsword, Sling, and Medium Armor. 

The absolute necessities are a backpack containing a bedroll and 8
Rations. Feel free to get any other items you want and have space for,
but consider leaving some room for other items you pick up along the
way. It's a good idea to make sure at least one person in your party has
a mess kit, rope, repair kit (the more the better), and torches.
