Limiting player options based on individual Attibute Mods can make sense, but we have to be careful about what we limit. Locking someone out of an ability for long can feel bad, but it can also work as a motivator.

Categorizing Attribute-locked abilities is easy enough (just tier them by Attribute Mod), but tiering general abilities is a bit more of a hassle. 
We'd have to tier them based on the sum of Attribute scores, and while that isn't too big of a problem to do, it might feel jarring to players that general abilities are categorized differently from Attribute-locked ones.
