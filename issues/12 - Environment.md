# General environemnt  stuff

At the start of each Shift, the GM rolls an Encounter Check (1d6 & 1d8) deciding "environment action table"

If a location was rolled, the party will come across the Location in that hex if they perform one of the following Exploration Activities or would otherwise be able to discover new places: Travel, Search, Hunt, Forage.
Mana Surge
The GM keeps track of the Saturation Level of the hex the Party stays in each Shift, totalling them at the end of the day.

At the end of each day all players make a Saturation Roll (Might + Presence) against the accumulated value. On a failure they mark one of their Focus as Corrupted. If all of a character’s Focus is already corrupted they instantly Mutate instead.
 
If a character starts spending Downtime Points in an area with no Mana Density, all Corrupted Focus becomes regular Focus.
Environment Actions
Each type of environment has one passive effect and a list of active effects the GM can use, each with their own cost. The GM can spend the Environment Tokens they gain from Encounter Rolls on these actions.’

Maybe GMs could receive Environment Tokens every round in combat, as the combat attracts attention? Could incentivize more agressive play
