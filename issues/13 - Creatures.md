Steel-wooled Dragonsheep - (I originally called it dragon-tailed sheep, but it’s fine). Mostly normal sheep with slightly larger horns, a fat scaly tail and rough reflective wool akin to steel wool. Maybe their colloquial name is Dragonsheep, but their official name in the Understanding 
Mountainback - Huge carnivorous deer with calcified growth on their back that acts as a shell and looks like a boulderis Dragon-tailed Sheep?
Tyrannosaurus Avis - A bird that convergently mutated into a similar body plan as the apex theropods, with a large crushing beak and tiny vestigial flightless wings.

Cube - Geometry given form, aquatic and lives like mola molas

Something like those elden ring snails where they live in skulls/bones

Something like that one animal that can mimic crying      -  This but sci-fi:

More developed creatures:
Drov’kith
Exoskeleton
6 limbs with talons at the end, can walk with the back 4
Queen reproduces asexually
Drones have wings and live where the Queen used to have wings, drones have potential to become queens
When a drone first hatches it will eat the Queen’s wings to make room for itself underneath the exoskeleton 
Queen can let its drones out by opening the part of the shell where its wings used to be
Holes in the face of the Queen can be used to issue orders to the drones, which sounds like a flute. When running at full speed a discordant sound is made by the holes, agitating the drones to attack whatever prey the Queen is running towards.
Syllix
Blind monster that senses mana in the area.
Essentially blind to creatures with little mana.

Vegetation


Ideas:

Tiny flowers with arms instead of petals
Floating trees - their roots “grab” a chunk of the earth as they mature, so that when they first bloom, they ascend up with it, creating small floating islands.
Trees with acidic wax on the leaves that pour down when it rains
Crystalblooms - Term for a family of vegetation stretching from flowers to trees featuring sharp crystal seeds that can confer crystalblight, a disease that makes more seeds grow as crystal protrusions in the body
Invisible mushrooms - Poisonous to the touch, but they emit an electromagnetic field around them that bends light so that they appear invisible, so that their prey walks into them.
A fun guy - Mushroom that grows in a jester shape and tells jokes
Boomshroom -  shroom that go boom
